# fract-ol-42-
## My hive (42) school project for fract-ol

This project was all about creating fractals that you could, in theory, infinitely zoom into. It uses a library provided by the school, callled: MinilibX. The library includes basic necessary tools to open a window, create images and deal with keyboard and mouse events. If you are not using one of 42's Macs, then you will have to download and install the MinilibX library. I've included those as tar archive files.

My fractol implements the Mandelbrot, Julia and Burningship sets.

use:


     ./fractol mandelbrot
     ./fractol julia [float] [float]
     ./fractol burningship

Once inside the program, movements and extra features are as follows:

- Space:       activate psycho mode ðŸ¤¡ðŸ”ª
- R:           reset
- Z:           autozoom
- Scroll:      +- zoom
- R&L click:   +- zoom
- Arrows:      move
- WASD:        move
- ESC & Q:     quit

Psycho mode is for hacking away on psychedelic effects. ;)
If you want to, and have the computing power to afford, you can go to the fractol.h file and increase the ITERATIONS count to draw a more accurate and "infinite" fractal.

This implementation passed all mandatory and bonues requirements.

The subject of the project is included as always.
